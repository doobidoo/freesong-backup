{t:Let It Be}
{st:The Beatles}
Wh[G]en I find myself in t[D]imes of trouble,
Mo[Em]ther Mary c[C]omes to me,
Sp[G]eaking words of w[D]isdom, let it [C]be.[G]
And in my hour of da[D]rkness,
She is st[Em]anding right in f[C]ront of me,
Sp[G]eaking words of w[D]isdom, let it [C]be.[G]

{c:Chorus:}
Let it [Em]be, let it [Bm]be, let it [C]be, let it [G]be.
Whisper words of wis[D]dom, let it [C]be.[G]

And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree,
There will be no answer, let it be.
But though there may be parting,
There is still a chance that they will see,
There will be an answer, let it be.

{c:Chorus.}

And when the night is cloudy,
There is still a light that shines on me,
Shine until tomorrow, let it be.
I wake up to the sound of music,
Mother Mary comes to me,
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

{c:Chorus.}
