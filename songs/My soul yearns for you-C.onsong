My soul yearns for you
Marco
Key: [C]

Vers 1:
My soul waits for you, for you the living One,
my spirit cries out to you, my rock and my salvation. 

Prechorus:
more than the watchman longs for the morning, 
more than the watchman waits for the sun,
seeking to find it on the horizon,
searching embracing, the new dawning day

Chorus:
rise up in me, Lord of the ages,
rise up in me, creator of life, 
show your great power, all of your splendour 
consume my heart, bridegroom and king
